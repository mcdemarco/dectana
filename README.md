# Dectana Deciphered

I was trying out the Decktet + Icehouse game Dectana, but I found the rules a bit hard to keep straight.  So I made this cheatsheet out of some other player aids.

Dectana is a 2--5 player Decktet game by Ryan Hackel; full rules are available at [his site](http://ceruleansgames.tripod.com/dectana.htm).

Dectana is a direct descendant of John Cooper's classic Icehouse game, Zarcana, and of Zarcana's reimplementation as Gnostica by John Cooper, Jacob Davenport, Kory Heath, and Kristin Matherly.</cite>  The [Decktet](http://www.decktet.com) is the creation of P.D. Magnus.  Looney Pyramids are the creation of Andy Looney.  See the cheatsheet itself for more credits and links.
